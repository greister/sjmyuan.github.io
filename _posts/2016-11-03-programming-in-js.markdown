### React

## 3. Unit Test

### [chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai)
Chai is an assertion library, similar to Node's build in assert. It makes testing much easier by giving you lots of assertions you can run against your code.


### [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme)
Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output.

### [sinon](https://github.com/sinonjs/sinon)
Standalone and test framework agnostic JavaScript test spies, stubs and mocks (pronounced "sigh-non").

### [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha)
Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. Hosted on GitHub.


### [pact](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-js)
The Pact family of frameworks provide support for [Consumer Driven Contracts](http://martinfowler.com/articles/consumerDrivenContracts.html) testing.

A Contract is a collection of agreements between a client (Consumer) and an API (Provider) that describes the interactions that can take place between them.

Consumer Driven Contracts is a pattern that drives the development of the Provider from its Consumers point of view.

Pact is a testing tool that guarantees those Contracts are satisfied.
