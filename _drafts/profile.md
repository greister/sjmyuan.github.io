# Previous Experience

## Xiâ€™an ZTE

### CSON System(2014/08 - 2016/05)

The sake of this system is to detect and resolve the coverage and capability problem of base station online. This system maintain a connection with OMC and download MR data from NDS(North Data Server). This system can detect the problem of base station in real time and send the solution to OMC without human intervention.

**My Responsibilities**:

 + Write the detailed design document
 + Use C++ to develop the CCO algorithm and invoke it by JNI interface
 + Construct the template management framework using scala
 + Analyze requirement, write sprint story backlog and manage the team

### SON Server System(2013/01 - 2014/08)

The sake of this system is to plan or optimize the configuration of base station fulfilled some rules. This system maintain a connection with the OMC and monitor the message from it. When this system receive a message from OMC, it will synchronize configuration with OMC at first, then run some algorithm based on the configuration and last send the result of algorithm to the OMC.


**My Responsibilities**:

 + Construct the upgrade framework using shell and C#, by using this framework, user can upgrade the system with just one command
 + Construct the patch management framework using shell and C#
 + Use shell to develop the disaster recovery scripts
 + Use java to develop the database adaptor framework, by which developer can be freed from the difference of  database, like Oracle, Sybase IQ
 + Use C++ to develop the PCI and Gota Prach algorithm and invoke them by JNI interface
 + Use python to write the framework which can automatically detect the changes on svn and build the corresponding patches.

### NetMAX-LTE System(2011/07 - 2012/12)

The sake of this system is to detect and resolve the coverage and capability problem of base station by analyzing the MR(Measure Report) data. This system download MR data from NDS(North Data Server), load them into the Oracle or Sybase IQ, and analyze these data on the client to detect the problem and find solution. This system support to export the analysis result into files and render them to GIS.

**My Responsibilities**:

 + Use C# to develop SON(Self-organizing Network) Functions
 + Use C# to develop GIS Module
 + Construct webservice framework using Tomcat and Axis2 for back-end and use java to develop authentication module, datamanager module, oracle database interface module.
