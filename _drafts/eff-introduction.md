# What's the problem?

## Effect order

# What's the solution?
## Unify the effect
* Open Union
* Eff-another implementation of Free Monad

## Inject and Project utilities
* MemberIn
* MemberInOut
* Member

## The final version
* Effect lift util
* Interpreter

# How to use it?

* Develop custom effect separately
* Declare the unified effect
* Lift custom effect to unified effect
* Develop the interpreter
* Develop the workflow
* Run all the interpreter

# Eff vs Free Monad

* There is no restriction on the mapping target for each effect's interpreter
* Easy to define the unified effect
* Easy to compose the interpreter
